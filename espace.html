					<h1>ESPACE application essay</h1>
					<div class="col-md-9 gtco-heading">
						<p>The <a href="https://www.bgu.tum.de/espace/welcome/" class="active">ESPACE</a> program, short for Earth-oriented space science and technology, is a satellite application engineering masters (MSc) offered at the 
						   <a href="https://www.tum.de/nc/en/homepage/" class="active">Technical University of Munich</a> (TUM). It is a program emphasizing the 
						   utilization of data produced by diverse types of satellites for various purposes.
						   An ESPACE almuni is commonly referred as the &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; between the satellite engineers and, for example, the Geophysicists designing a space mission.</p>
						<p>As part of the application process, the applicants had to write an essay of 500 to 700 words, on a scientific topic of their choice in the 
						   field of Earth-oriented space science and technology. Thus, here is the essay I sent to the admission board. Following a video interview, <u>I was then accepted 
						   in the program for the October 2018 intake</u>.</p>

					<h1>The new satellite mega-constellations</h1>
					<div class="col-md-9 gtco-heading">
						<h3>An orbiting, omnipresent nexus</h3>
						<p align="justify">Increasing interconnectivity, an ever-growing demand for communication bandwidth and
						the rise of new products and services have a significant impact on space economy. Projected 
						to triple by 2021[3], the world-wide broadband activity needs have already promoted
						a slow shift in the satellite industry.</p>

						<p align="justify">Typically, strict requirements in the spatial and temporal availability of the orbiting spacecrafts 
						pose a set of challenges for the space industry to overcome. However, as satellites
						get smaller and cheaper, these needs can now be satisfied through the development of
						mega-constellations: globally spread, interconnected networks of hundreds to thousands
						of telecommunication satellites.</p>

						<p align="justify">As with any endeavor of this extent, the shift comes with its lot of problems. In the long
						term, launching a large amount of little satellites generates a great deal of space debris
						below the inner Van Halen belt. Moreover, cross-linkage, mass manufacturing, thorough
						testing, collision avoidance and the inexistent regulatory framework of these orbiting infrastructures 
						are equally as challenging[8]</p>

						<h3>Globalization and growth</h3>
						<p align="justify">In retrospect, the introduction of 2G digital cellular networks at the dawn of the 80s by
						Nordic Mobile Telephone [10] is a great example where the use of several wireless stations
						meant a better overall service. Similarly, upcoming projects of mega-constellations, proposed 
						by OneWeb or SpaceX, rely on the amount of nodes, their orbit, along with their
						network topology to improve many key areas of satellite communication.</p>

						<p align="justify">Latency, coverage and cost are three subfields that come forward. Present in Low-Earth
						Orbit, these mega-structures don’t favor availability at the expense of latency like their
						GEO counterparts[5]. While application-dependent, latency still has a meaningful role in
						space-based communications, even when software can mitigate its effects. In addition,
						having so many interconnected satellites moving together increases significantly the total
						coverage. A mega-constellation, constantly moving relative to Earth at a given moment,
						handles ground communication by successively handing off a spacecraft’s service to the
						next in the constellation. Moreover, MCs provide a lower financial risk by their redundant
						approach, as well as their relatively inexpensive launch in orbit. They also require less
						power to operate than Geo-stationary satellites.</p>

						<p align="justify">In a world constantly affected by technological changes, Pearson claims that the simple
						use of “mobile telephony [technology] is a key contributor to enabling us to keep track of,
						and successfully participate in, a set of relationships in a complex, social world”[6]. Hence,
						one can easily extrapolate that offering better, cheaper broadband coverage and services
						will play a significant role in the growth and promotion of world-wide economy, especially
						in remote locations and developing countries[6]</p>

						<h3>The challenges</h3>
						<p align="justify">Historically, under the space industry’s great inertia, the introduction of new paradigms
						like this one, touted as being relatively cheap and efficient, is doubted. There is indeed
						several challenges that need to be addressed, considering the extent of these vast projects.</p>

						<p align="justify">Firstly, having a network of hundreds of satellites in space for the same purpose means
						they have to work together. As was previously stated, a connection to the ground will
						have to be handled by multiple spacecrafts, which means interfacing between network
						nodes becomes essential for nominal communications. From the ground segment’s viewpoint,
						being able to treat a group of satellites as if it were a single entity is highly desirable,
						otherwise the cost skyrockets[1].</p>

						<p align="justify">Then comes the complication with space debris. Nowadays, only 20% of satellites above
						650km even attempt to deorbit[4], causing an alarming accumulation of debris in LEO.
						Thus, the introduction of mega-constellations is raising some important questions on that
						matter. How can we mitigate the amount of space debris when MCs are nearing their end
						of life? Holger Krag, head of ESA’s Space Debris Office, argues that at least 90% of LEO
						satellites will need to deorbit within 25 years in order to control the creation of debris[4]
						.With this in mind, the post-mission disposal success rate will need to be as high as possible.</p>

					<div class="col-md-9 gtco-heading">
						<h3>Conclusion</h3>
						<p align="justify">In the end, future improvements of spacecraft technology will likely give rise to successful
						missions that can produce a better product at a better price. As the demand for availability
						and quality of services increase and space-based technology continues to develop, one
						will hopefully see, in the long run, sustainable, efficient solutions integrated in today’s
						space-based communication infrastructure.</p>
